# MERN-search-engine

## Description
This project is a book search engine built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and a RESTful API. 
The challenge is to refactor this application to use a GraphQL API with Apollo Server. The application allows users to search for books, 
view details, save books to their account, and manage their saved books.

## Technologies used

Refactor the RESTful API to GraphQL using Apollo Server for queries and mutations.

Authentication Middleware:

Apollo Provider:
Configure Apollo Provider to facilitate communication between React and Apollo Server.

Deployment:
Deploy the application to Render for public access.

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
MongoDB instance
GraphQL and Apollo Server knowledge
Render account for deployment
